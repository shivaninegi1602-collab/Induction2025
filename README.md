# Day 1
## My first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was a very good experience for me. First of all we went to college Gurdwara Sahib and there we welcomed the beginning of a new phase of our life with the blessings of God. After having our refreshments at the hostel, we went to the college auditorium for our induction program.
