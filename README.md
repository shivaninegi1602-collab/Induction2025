# ACTIVITY REPORT OF INDUCTION PROGRAM

## Day 1
### July 31,2025
My first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was a very good experience for me. First of all we went to college Gurdwara Sahib and there we started a new phase of our life with the blessings of God. After having our refreshments at the hostel, we went to the college auditorium for our induction program.

Upon reaching the auditorium, we received a warm and heartfelt welcome. Mr. Harsimram Singh proudly shared how GNDEC students are excelling across the globe, thanks to the college’s nurturing environment that encourages skill development and innovation.

We were then inspired by a message from Sangam Arora, the CSE Topper of the 2021–2025 batch. He encouraged us to make the most of our college life, not just in classrooms but also through extracurricular experiences. His words reminded us to start working toward our dreams from the very first day.

Next, Arshpreet Singh, the IT Topper of the 2021–2025 batch, addressed us. He emphasized the importance of balancing academics with co-curricular activities, and of cultivating skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership to prepare ourselves for the professional world.

Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HoD, Applied Sciences) then welcomed us with her inspiring words. She beautifully explained that success isn’t just about high placements and big packages—it’s built step by step through passion, prayer, and persistence.

Following her, Dr. Akshay Girdhar likened our college journey to a T-shaped graph—the horizontal axis representing the small, consistent steps we take to improve ourselves, and the vertical axis representing our growth. He urged us to ask questions, learn from our teachers and seniors, and never hesitate to seek guidance.

Prof. Harleen Kaur Grewal encouraged us to believe in ourselves, assuring us that with dedication and hard work, we can surpass even our own limits.

Finally, our Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, welcomed us to GNDEC. He reminded us that engineering is deeply connected to everyday life, with every branch holding its own significance. He assured us that GNDEC offers the perfect environment to develop our skills and prepare for future challenges.

 After this, Dr. Kulwinder Singh Mann (HoD, IT) offered his heartfelt wishes. He expressed his hope that when we leave GNDEC, each of us will have achieved our dreams.

Leaving the auditorium that day, I felt an overwhelming sense of pride, gratitude, and excitement. It was clear to me that GNDEC is not just a college—it’s a place that shapes dreams into reality.
