# ACTIVITY REPORT OF INDUCTION PROGRAM

## Day 1 - July 31,2025
My first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was a very good experience for me. First of all we went to college Gurdwara Sahib and there we started a new chapter of our life with the blessings of God. After having our refreshments at the hostel, we went to the college auditorium for our induction program.

Upon reaching the auditorium, we received a warm and heartfelt welcome. Mr. Harsimram Singh proudly shared how GNDEC students are excelling across the globe, thanks to the college’s nurturing environment that encourages skill development and innovation.

We were then inspired by a message from Sangam Arora, the CSE Topper of the 2021–2025 batch. He encouraged us to make the most of our college life, not just in classrooms but also through extracurricular experiences. His words reminded us to start working toward our dreams from the very first day.

Next, Arshpreet Singh, the IT Topper of the 2021–2025 batch, addressed us. He emphasized the importance of balancing academics with co-curricular activities, and of cultivating skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership to prepare ourselves for the professional world.

Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HoD, Applied Sciences) then welcomed us with her inspiring words. She beautifully explained that success isn’t just about high placements and big packages—it’s built step by step through passion, prayer, and persistence.

Following her, Dr. Akshay Girdhar likened our college journey to a T-shaped graph—the horizontal axis representing the small, consistent steps we take to improve ourselves, and the vertical axis representing our growth. He urged us to ask questions, learn from our teachers and seniors, and never hesitate to seek guidance.

Prof. Harleen Kaur Grewal encouraged us to believe in ourselves, assuring us that with dedication and hard work, we can surpass even our own limits.

Finally, our Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, welcomed us to GNDEC. He reminded us that engineering is deeply connected to everyday life, with every branch holding its own significance. He assured us that GNDEC offers the perfect environment to develop our skills and prepare for future challenges.

 After this, Dr. Kulwinder Singh Mann (HoD, IT) offered his heartfelt wishes. He expressed his hope that when we leave GNDEC, each of us will have achieved our dreams.

Leaving the auditorium that day, I felt an overwhelming sense of pride, gratitude, and excitement. It was clear to me that GNDEC is not just a college—it’s a place that shapes dreams into reality.

## Day 2 - August 01,2025

The day began with English and Mathematics Proficiency Tests, where we answered basic grammar and mathematics questions up to the Class 12 level. It felt like a gentle yet engaging way to revisit our foundations.

Afterwards, we gathered in the auditorium for an introduction to the Buddy4Study platform. We learned about the Satya Scholarship, its benefits, and how it could support students in pursuing their education without financial worries. Step-by-step, we were guided through the process of logging into the platform and applying for scholarships. It was heartening to know that such opportunities exist to ensure that no student’s learning is hindered by financial constraints.

Later, we were introduced to GitHub, an essential tool for programmers. We learned how to create repositories, write and manage content, and use the platform effectively—marking the beginning of our journey into collaborative coding and project development.

## Day 3 - August 2, 2025
The day opened with one of the most fascinating lectures so far. In the auditorium, Dr. Jaswinder Singh demonstrated a series of intriguing experiments while weaving deep life lessons into his talk. He spoke about the meaning of God and, through various examples, emphasized the importance of mathematics in our lives. He explained that mathematics forms the foundation of all sciences and that every aspect of life is connected to it.

Through fun activities, he helped us understand complex concepts and even taught us how to count all the bones in the human body. He also shared inspiring stories of people whose lives continue to serve as motivation for others.

Following this, we attended an expert lecture on Universal Human Values by Dr. Priya Darshini Ma’am. She began by asking us about our ultimate goal in life. Together, we agreed that the core aspiration for every human being is the continuity of happiness and prosperity.

She guided us to reflect on how we pursue these goals, explaining that physical facilities alone cannot fulfill all human needs—relationships and a sense of connection are equally vital. She stressed that right understanding is even more important than material possessions or relationships, and that we should dedicate time to developing this understanding to lead a truly fulfilling life.

## Day 4 - August 4, 2025
The day began with an engaging Chemistry lecture by Dr. Rajvir Kaur Ma’am in the seminar hall. She encouraged us to see chemistry not merely as an academic subject, but as something deeply connected to our daily lives. Through simple yet impactful examples, she explained how basic concepts of chemistry have practical applications all around us. She also outlined our syllabus and examination pattern.

Dr. Rajvir Ma’am reminded us that creativity and innovation are vital, no matter the field we choose. She urged us to share our ideas openly, as innovation grows when minds connect.

Next, we attended a peer-to-peer session on the basics of C++ programming. We learned about variables, data types, and the syntax needed to write simple programs—laying the foundation for our journey in coding.

After that, Dr. Priya Darshini Ma’am delivered another enlightening lecture on Universal Human Values. She explained that our self and our body are two distinct entities, and that true, lasting happiness cannot be achieved by pursuing only bodily pleasures. She highlighted the difference between excitement and genuine happiness, and spoke about acting according to our natural acceptance—making choices that nurture rather than harm our body and mind. She concluded with thought-provoking insights into the true meaning and ultimate purpose of life.

Later, the Causmic Club members introduced us to their work, showcasing their innovations, creative projects, and events. They also guided us to explore their website for more information.

The day ended with practical advice on buying a laptop for our programming journey. We were shown different models, explained their features, and guided on choosing the right one according to our needs and budget.
