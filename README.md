# Day 1
## My first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College was a very good experience for me. First of all we went to college Gurdwara Sahib and there we started a new phase of our life with the blessings of God. After having our refreshments at the hostel, we went to the college auditorium for our induction program.

## After reaching the auditorium, we had a very warm and beautiful welcome. Then Harsimram Singh showed us that the students of GNDEC are shining all over the world as the college has provided a very good atmosphere to the students for developing new skills in them.

## Then we had a message from Sangam Arora (CSE Topper) of 2021-2025 batch. He told us to explore our college life not only inside the classrooms but also outside it and make our college journey fruitful by enhancing our skills. He advised us to start preparing for our dreams and doing efforts for them from the first day of our college.

## Then we were addressed by Arshpreet Singh (IT Topper) of 2021-2025 batch. He told us that in addition to our studies, we should work on our co-curricular activities and develop values such as team work, communication skills and many more in ourselves.
